# Fictitious-Brand-Website

This is a fictitious website for code demonstration. It is build with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I intend to create a separate CSS file but by now all of the CSS code is inside the HTML file and all of the Bootstrap code too.

This website simulates a company that sells software. It is, as shown in the tile, fictitious. The company shown in this website does not exist as it is portrayed in the code. The sole purpose of this code is to demonstrate code in order to show it in possible future job interviews.
